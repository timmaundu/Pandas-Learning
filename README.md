# Pandas-Learning
This repository contains code that I wrote while learning how to use Pandas. The code is organized into the following folders:

data: Files with .csv contains all the datasets used.
notebook: The file Learning Pandas.ipynb contains the Jupyter notebook that I used to explore the data and write the Python scripts.
I hope that this repository will be helpful to other people who are learning how to use Pandas.
